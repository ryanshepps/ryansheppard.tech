I’ve heard some consistent takes from friends and family saying “most people are idiots”, “society is getting dumber and dumber as we speak” and “people have no common sense”. These sayings are almost always ego driven, and it irks me every time I hear another version of the statement. I believe these views are wrong, and we need to be taking a different approach. People are good, and believing that you, or a subset of humanity are the only ones doing good is inherently ego-driven. The quicker we get to realizing this, the quicker we can get to advancing humanity.

### **Everyone Thinks they are doing Good**

No one, not even the worst of humankind, thinks they are doing something bad. Everyone has a justification on why they are doing something, and it always boils down to them doing something they believe is fundamentally good. 

In 2001, Enron, a natural gas and pipeline company, filed for bankruptcy after attributing $40 to $45 billion to fraud. In 2013 Andy Fastow, the CFO of Enron at the time, is quoted in an interview with fortune.com as saying “When I was working at Enron, you know, I was kind of a hero, because I helped the company make its numbers every quarter. And I thought I was doing a good thing. I thought I was smart” ([source](https://fortune.com/2013/07/01/the-confessions-of-andy-fastow/)).

In 2022 Elizabeth Holmes was convicted on four counts of wire fraud after defrauding investors of approximately $140 million for claiming that her company had devised a device that could run blood tests accurately, rapidly and with a very minimal amount of blood. In 2014 during an interview with fortune.com, Holmes is cited as saying “This is about being able to do good” and later explains her motivations as “I genuinely don’t believe anything else matters more than when you love someone so much and you have to say goodbye too soon” ([source](https://fortune.com/2014/06/12/theranos-blood-holmes/)).

Even Al Capone, notorious criminal in the 1920s and 30s who committed crimes such as racketeering, extortion, murder and bribery is quoted as saying “I have spent the best years of my life giving people the lighter pleasures, helping them have a good time, and all I get is abuse, the existence of a hunted man”.

Look, I’m not arguing that what these people have done is good — not at all — but I am trying to show that everyone has a justification for why what they’re doing is good. Understanding their motivations does not excuse their actions. We can simultaneously recognize someone’s good intentions while still holding them responsible for harm caused. We can seek to understand motivations while not accepting that all outcomes are equally good. I am not arguing that white supremacists, terrorists or anti-semites are good and if this is your response to my argument, you should read this paragraph again.

Once you recognize this pattern — that everyone justifies their actions as good — you start to see the real problem isn’t that some people are evil while others are good. The problem is that we all think we’re the good ones.

### **Your Ego is Getting in the way**

When you believe that you and people like you are the only “truly good” people, you’re claiming moral superiority over billions of people. This isn’t insight — it’s arrogance dressed up as wisdom. You’re placing yourself in an exclusive club of the enlightened while dismissing everyone else as fundamentally flawed. What are the odds that you — out of 8 billion people — are among the select few who truly “get it”?

This is more than just an interpersonal problem. It’s reducing humanity’s problem-solving capacity. Understanding that people are trying to do good gives us more compassion and understanding for what others are trying to do. When we immediately discredit someone as evil, wrong, or stupid because we are part of the side doing good and they are part of the side doing wrong, we drop the ability for collaboration and eliminate the possibility of tapping into their knowledge, creativity, background, history and resources.

I've unfortunately seen too many instances of this affecting how we live and reducing our ability to advance together. I still get notifications from a Facebook group I joined while living in my university town. The most engaged posts are often about problematic drivers, with comments like "this town's driving ability has been going downhill year after year." Or they're about doorbell footage showing package theft, with people asking "what is wrong with humanity?”. Why are we painting such a wide brush given one person’s circumstances?

I can go on about how alienation across all levels of the Canadian government — from federal to municipal to law enforcement — is also driven by ego and hinders human advancement, but I’ll save that for another post.

### **Looking Forward**

I hope to see more instances of people looking for reasons to unite with one another rather than divide. We are all trying to do good, and I think that makes us good. If we weren’t so tied up with criticizing others and complaining how there is so much wrong with the world, we could all be more effective at identifying genuine threats and advancing humanity in the right direction. The sooner we realize this, the quicker we can get to advancing humanity.
